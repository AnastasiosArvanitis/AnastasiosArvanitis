#### I have been a web developer between 2000 and 2005, I have done many other interesting things later on, only to come back to programming. Since 2021 I am working on the Salesforce ecosystem.

#### I love developing in Apex and LWC ðŸ¤“ and I am a Trailhead & VS Code geek! 

##### âš¡I am an expert on challenges like:
- Rest API

In my life I have tried many and different stuff and I have worked with a lot of people. Adaptation has become my second nature, working hard and always learning and improving have become my most important values.
